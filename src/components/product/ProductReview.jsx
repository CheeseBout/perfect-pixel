          <strong>Even my husband noticed... the spark came back.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>After years of hiding under coverups, picking apart my body, and feeling disconnected, I finally feel at ease again. I feel less bloated, lighter, like my body is working with me not against me. These past months, I’ve been present. Even my marriage feels renewed, not just in how I look but in how I feel. It’s hard to explain, but once you try it you’ll get it. I’d recommend this to my closest friends without question.</p>
